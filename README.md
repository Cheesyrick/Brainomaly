Brainomaly - Brain Tumor Detection Web App

This is the repository for the Brainomaly web application, a user-friendly tool that leverages a powerful deep learning model to detect the presence of brain tumors from MRI scan images.

‚û°Ô∏è Live Demo: brainomaly-app.netlify.app
üìñ Overview

Brainomaly provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to get an instant prediction on whether a brain MRI scan shows signs of a tumor. Simply upload an image, and our AI model will analyze it and provide a result in seconds.

This project aims to make medical imaging analysis more accessible and serves as a practical demonstration of the power of AI in healthcare.
‚ú® Key Features

    Simple Image Upload: Easily upload brain MRI images in common formats (JPG).

    Instant AI Prediction: Get a fast analysis and prediction from the trained AI model.

    Clear Results: View a straightforward result ("Tumor Detected" or "No Tumor Detected").

    Web-Based: No installation required. Accessible from any modern web browser.

üöÄ How to Use the App
